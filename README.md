# Qpdf

Grand Rounds simple forking wrapper around the
(qpdf)[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf] executable.

We wrote it ourselves because there was no simple
Ruby wrapper for `qpdf`. It is roughly copied from the
(pdftk)[https://rubygems.org/gems/pdftk] gem, which is not actively
maintained as of this writing.
